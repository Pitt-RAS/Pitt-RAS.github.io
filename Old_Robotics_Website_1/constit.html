<h1 align=center style='text-align:center'>Constitution of the Robotics Club</h1>

<h2>Preamble</h2>

<p>This constitution defines the Robotics Club, hereinafter referred to as RC,
as an organization that promotes the experimentation with robotics, provides a
forum for discussion and sharing information, and gives its members a community
to participate in and learn about the field of robotics.</p>

<h2>Article I - Club Membership</h2>

<p>The RC welcomes anyone with an interest in robotics. Membership to the RC is
open to anyone involved with the University of Pittsburgh including, but not
limited to, current students and alumni, faculty and staff of the University of
Pittsburgh, and other non-university persons.</p>

<h3>A. Regular Membership</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Current students of the University of Pittsburgh
can apply for regular membership with the RC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Anyone who wishes to be a member must contact the Executive Board. Only
regular members of the RC may vote.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>No
hazing or illegal discrimination will be used as a condition of regular
membership in the RC.</p>

<h3>B. Associate Membership</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Alumni of the University of Pittsburgh,
non-university persons, faculty and staff may participate in the meetings and
activities of the RC at the approval of the Executive Board.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, voting privileges are limited to
only active regular members in good standing with the RC.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>No hazing or illegal discrimination will be
used as a condition of membership in the RC.</p>

<h3>C. Membership Procedure and Expiration</h3>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>The procedure for becoming a regular or associate
member of the RC is the same.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
applicant must contact the Executive Board with his/her intention to join; if
necessary, the applicant must fill out all paperwork.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>It is the Executive Board’s decision whether or not to accept
membership proposals.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.5in'>Regular membership expires after graduation from
the University for students and one year for faculty and staff, unless
circumstances cause early termination.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Associate membership expires after one year, unless circumstances cause
early termination.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Ex-members may
re-apply for membership in the RC.</p>

<h3>D. Grounds for Removal</h3>

shall set a date when the proceedings shall take place. The date of the
proceedings shall be no sooner than 30 days after the initial charge is made.
During the removal proceedings, the accused member shall have an opportunity to

For the accused member to be removed the Executive Board must vote unanimously
and there must be a majority of votes made by the attending regular
members.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If expelled from the RC, the
former member may be denied membership if the Executive Board deems his or her
continued participation and inimical to the objectives of the RC.</p>
