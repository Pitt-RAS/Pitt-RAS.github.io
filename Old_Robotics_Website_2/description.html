<b>RC Voting and Feedback</b>

<br><br>

Thank you for your interest in giving us feedback.  This is in order
to help make the club better for you.  Please enter your Pitt e-mail
address.  If you are concerned about people possibly reading your
voting, you can select the Private Entry and only officers will be 
able to see how you responded.

The first two voting items are for proposed ammendments for the Constitution.
The officers have reached the decision that these ammendments to the constitution
may help make the club better, we just need a vote of approval.

<b>Limit President to two terms?:</b> A club goes nowhere without a strong and
capable leader.  However, it might be better that we limit a person to holding
two terms in the presidential office.  This gives fresh blood to club so that it
does not get stuck in a rut.  This also ensures that after a president graduates, 
he or she would not have been in leadership so long that no one else really knows
how to lead the club.

<br><br>

<b>Spending approved by officers?:</b> Currently, there are not many restrictions on
how money is spent in the club.  With this ammendment, three out of the four officers
must agree to they way money is being spent for an individual's project before it is
spent.  This is to keep better tabs on our budget.

The next two items are to help make the club better for you next semester.  We ask that
you choose two of the five activities for next semester.  

<br><br>

<b>Laser Tag:</b> Making robots that play laser tag with each other.  You would be provided
with all the materials and knowledge necessary to make them.

<br><br>

<b>Battle Bots:</b> This would be a club competition with small robots (probably under 20lbs).

<br><br>

<b>Ground Vehicle:</b> Autonomous free-range navigation and obstacle avoidance over a 1.8 acre area, closed outdoor obstacle course.  The robot would be about the size of a riding lawnmower.  <a  href="http://www.igvc.org" target="_blank">http://www.igvc.org</a>

<b>Robocup:</b> Four AIBO dogs playing soccer against another team of dogs.  Involves multi-robot communication and coordination.  <a href="http://www.openr.org/robocup">http:/www.openr.org/robocup</a>
