<br><br><br><font face="Verdana, Arial" size=+1><b>Preamble</b></font><br>
<font face="Verdana, Arial">This constitution defines the Robotics Club, hereinafter referred to as RC, as an organization that promotes the experimentation with robotics, provides a forum for discussion and sharing information, and gives its members a community to participate in and learn about the field of robotics.
<br><br><br>
<font face="Verdana, Arial" size=+1><b>Article I - Club Membership</b></font><br>
<font face="Verdana, Arial">The RC welcomes anyone with an interest in robotics. Membership to the RC is open to anyone involved with the University of Pittsburgh including, but not limited to, current students and alumni, faculty and staff of the University of Pittsburgh, and other non-university persons.
<br><br>
<b>A. Regular Membership</b><br>
Current students of the University of Pittsburgh can apply for regular membership with the RC.  Anyone who wishes to be a member must contact the Executive Board. Only regular members of the RC may vote.  No hazing or illegal discrimination will be used as a condition of regular membership in the RC.
<br><br>
<b>B. Associate Membership</b><br>
Alumni of the University of Pittsburgh, non-university persons, faculty and staff may participate in the meetings and activities of the RC at the approval of the Executive Board.  However, voting privileges are limited to only active regular members in good standing with the RC.  No hazing or illegal discrimination will be used as a condition of membership in the RC.
<br><br>
<b>C. Membership Procedure and Expiration</b><br>
The procedure for becoming a regular or associate member of the RC is the same.  The applicant must contact the Executive Board with his/her intention to join; if necessary, the applicant must fill out all paperwork.  It is the Executive Board’s decision whether or not to accept membership proposals.
<br><br>
Regular membership expires after graduation from the University for students and one year for faculty and staff, unless circumstances cause early termination.  Associate membership expires after one year, unless circumstances cause early termination.  Ex-members may re-apply for membership in the RC.
<br><br>
<b>D. Grounds for Removal</b><br>
Grounds for removal of a RC member shall include any action deemed inappropriate and inimical to the objectives of the RC by the Executive Board. Initiation of removal proceedings shall begin with a charge made by an Executive Board member. Once the charge is made, the Executive Board shall set a date when the proceedings shall take place. The date of the proceedings shall be no sooner than 30 days after the initial charge is made. During the removal proceedings, the accused member shall have an opportunity to defend him/herself.  Once the accused member has had a chance to speak, a vote on his or her removal shall take place. The quorum for voting shall be the rest of the Executive Board and 10 regular RC members, or as close to 10 as possible given the membership roster. For the accused member to be removed the Executive Board must vote unanimously and there must be a majority of votes made by the attending regular members.  If expelled from the RC, the former member may be denied membership if the Executive Board deems his or her continued participation and inimical to the objectives of the RC.
<br><br><br>
<font face="Verdana, Arial" size=+1><b>Article II - The Executive Board</b></font><br>
<font face="Verdana, Arial">The Executive Board, hereafter referred to as the Board, shall be made up of the President, Vice President, Treasurer, and Secretary.  The Board shall be involved in setting up activities and organizational committees, organizing meetings, handling public relations, forming external affiliations, establishing the budget, allocating and securing funding, and making other decisions relevant to the RC.  The board shall make general decisions based on consensus.  In the event that a consensus among the Board members cannot be reached, the faculty advisor shall cast a vote to end the deadlock, per restrictions stated below.
<br><br>
<b>A. Board Members</b><br>
The President shall be the head of the Board, and shall set the schedule for general and Board meetings, conduct those meetings, and be the main representative of the RC to other people and groups.  The President shall also organize the elections of Board members.  In the event that the President is unavailable to handle meetings or deal with conflicts that require immediate attention, the Vice President, Treasurer, or Secretary can substitute for him, in that order.
<br><br>
The Vice President shall facilitate the communication between the Board and general members, as well as to prepare and conduct activities set up by the Board that may deal with, but are not limited to, setting up committees, securing open lab space for members to work on their own creations, tours, lectures and other events.

<br><br>
<b>B. Voting for Board Members</b><br>
At the first general RC meeting of the academic year, regular members in good standing with the RC can be nominated for one or more of the Board positions by other RC members.

Any Board member may voluntarily resign from their position.  He or she must inform the rest of the Board of his or her decision in writing.  The Board member’s resignation goes into effect after the next general body meeting or as deemed necessary by the Board.  Resignation of a Board member does not remove him or her from general RC membership.
<br><br>
Grounds for a forced removal of a Board member shall include, conviction of a felony during the term of office, dereliction of duties, or any action deemed inappropriate and inimical to the objectives of the RC by the Board.  Initiation of removal proceedings shall begin with a charge made by a Board member. Once the charge is made, the Board shall set a date when the proceedings shall take place. The date of the proceedings shall be no sooner than 30 days after the initial charge is made. During the removal proceedings, the accused member shall have an opportunity to defend him/herself.  Once the accused member has had a chance to speak, a vote on his or her removal shall take place. The quorum for voting shall be the rest of the Board and 10 regular RC members, or as close to 10 as possible given the membership roster. For the accused Board member to be removed the remaining Executive Board must vote unanimously and there must be a majority of votes made by the attending regular members.  Dismissal of a Board member does not remove him or her from general RC membership.
<br><br>
Nomination of replacement Board members for vacant positions shall take place at the general body meeting that immediately follows the removal or resignation.  If a member is nominated for more than one position, then the nominee shall decide on which position or positions for which to run if at all.

<br><br>
There may be more than one faculty advisor, but only one my vote at any one meeting.  The advisors shall draw lots to determine who shall vote during the meeting.
