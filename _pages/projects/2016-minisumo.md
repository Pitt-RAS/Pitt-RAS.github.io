description: A sumo robot competition is a competition where two sumo robots go head to head in an attempt to push the other outside of the dojo. What differentiates a mini sumo robot from a traditional sumo robot is all about size. In the IEEE Region 2 SAC, the rules were 500grams, 10cmx10cm, and a max of $250.
