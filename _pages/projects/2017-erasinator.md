Ever wondered how much time is wasted in class by erasing whiteboards? It adds up over time to be a lot! What if there was a way to erase the whiteboard automatically, and with hardly any user input? That’s our goal!

We are designing and fabricating a robot capable of erasing any whiteboard it is attached to. It will make use of limit switches to determine the dimensions of the board, and then it will get to work!

Our design also features the ability to not erase certain parts of the board provided those sections are circled with a designated marker color. The robot will utilize RGB color sensors to detect these circled sections, and proceed to drive around them.

Those interested in joining our team will gain hands on experience in mechanical design, motor selection, circuitry, and coding. Let’s get erasing!
