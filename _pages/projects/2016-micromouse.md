    <p>The RAS micromouse currently has

    a PCB equipped with motors, encoders,

    gyroscope, accelerometer, a Teensy

    microprocessor and four rangefinders so

    that the robot can “see”.  We are setting

    its motors using a combination of

    encoder ticks, rangefinder error, and

    gyroscope error to get an ideal motion. 

    Using data collected from the

    rangefinders, the robot can also gather

    wall locations that are passed to our

    maze solving algorithm to get the

    shortest route to the goal location.  It

    can currently run a maze, autonomously

    moving to the optimal location based on

    our algorithm, and correcting during

    those movements to either stay straight

    inside each cell or compare ideal offset

    to actual offset to stay correct inside a

    turn.
