Dragglebot is a flatbed cart capable of autonomously following a user walking in front of it to more easily transport heavy objects, and of following other carts to transport more in one trip. Dragglebot aims to be versatile and hardy enough to operate on sidewalks, being able to go over bumps, cracks, or potholes, and capable of avoiding simple collisions.
