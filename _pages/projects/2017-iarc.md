The [International Aerial Robotics Competition (IARC)](http://aerialroboticscompetition.org) is an annual competition requiring teams to develop aerial robots that solve problems on the cutting edge of what is currently achievable by any robots, whether owned by industry or governments.  The current mission, and the one we're working on, involves developing an autonomous drone capable of interacting with randomly moving robots on the ground to direct them towards a goal.
