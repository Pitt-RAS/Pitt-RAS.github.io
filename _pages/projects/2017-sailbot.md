SailBot is an autonomous sailboat made to compete in the annual International Robotic Sailing Competition. This competition, which occurs in the early summer, tests various aspects of the sailboat’s design, including: speed of navigation, ability to maintain position, ability to locate and avoid obstacles, and maximum allowable payload. After the competition, the robot will be retrofitted to perform autonomous water testing in Pittsburgh’s rivers.
