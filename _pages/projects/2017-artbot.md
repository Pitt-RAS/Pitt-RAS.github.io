The goal of Artbot is to create a robotic panther that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing that will be displayed in the lobby of Benedum Hall. We have developed custom Arduino libraries to control the series of motors and actuators in the Panther as well as incorporated facial detection software to allow the panther to "see" and track people by moving its head. We also created an accompanying touchscreen kiosk/user interface to allow current and prospective students to interact with the panther and learn more information about the university.
