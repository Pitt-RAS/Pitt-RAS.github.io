               The goal of the Minisumo project is to design an autonomous robot which can knockits opponents out of the ring in a head to head competition. The event is held every year during the IEEE Student Activities Conference. This year, due to COVID-19, the team is planning to compete in the “kit” competition, an entirely software-based event where each team starts with the same robot and tries to develop the best software for the competition.</p>
