If you have even the slightest interest in robotics, automation, electronics, programming, or mechanics, this just might be the club for you! In Robotics club there is absolutely no commitment and it is entirely free of any membership fees. The club is a great, fun and exciting way to learn and apply key concepts to building robots. We maintain a fun, relaxed, hands on, and team oriented environment. Students of all experience levels and majors are welcome as we will teach you everything you need to know to get started and will get everyone involved. Our upperclass and graduate members are always eager to share their years of experience with you and will try their best to answer any questions you may have.

In the Robotics Club lab, located in 920 Benedum Hall, we stock many different types of electronic components typically used to build robots. The club primarily uses Microchip's PIC microcontrollers and has the capability of programming and debugging these chips. To bring your robot to life, you can choose from a wide variety of DC motors and hobby servos. For perfecting the functionality of circuits, we have nearly a dozen digital multimeters and three oscilloscopes (one of which is capable of acting as a logic analyzer). If any of this means absolutely nothing to you don't worry, we will teach you! We also have plenty of tools and materials to construct the robot frames.
