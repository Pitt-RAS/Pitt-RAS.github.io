The Scorpion is currently in the design phase. We will be finishing up preliminary designs and picking out parts in the next couple of weeks. The end goal of this project is to design and build a scorpion bot that can mimic the natural motions of a real scorpion. In addition we are hoping to be able to interface it with a myo band, so we can control the bot through our hand gestures. In order to make it more of a challenge we have decided to use one of the TI microcontrollers in place of the usual arduino or teensy. In addition to using the TI chip we would like to design a pcb for the chip, so we will be able to remove any unnecessary ports and pins. The code will be written in C and will be mostly firmware and servo control heavy.
