<p>
We are happy to announce that one of our teams competed at the American Venue of the International Aerial Robotics Competition last week, and won an award for Best System Design.  Although no team was able to fully complete the mission, we did achieve the highest overall score out of all the teams at the American Venue.

A brief slide presentation summarizing our design can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1F9x-67_rmV7ZRk-LWHBCSgSK5SHhnXwNupj2cx1uu7o/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.  A more thorough description of the successes and flaws in our approach will be posted on this website shortly.
