<p>
We will be having an Arduino building competition for our GBM next Tuesday, November 7th! You'll get to split up in small groups to build the spookiest project possible in 2 hours. There will be pizza for all and prizes for winning team, including Arduinos and/or snack shack credit. Please come even if you don't have experience with Arduinos, we'll make sure that every team has someone with experience and projects will be judged on creativity.
