<p>
We are having a GBM this Tuesday, November 14th, with two speakers from NREC (National Robotics Engineering Center). One, Matt Schnur, is a recent Pitt Computer Engineering alumnus! They will talk a little about their experiences working in robotics and then answer questions you guys have about NREC, careers in robotics, or anything else you'd like to know. Please bring questions for them!

We will be meeting in Old Engineering Hall room 300 at 6 PM. As always, there will be pizza! Hope to see everyone there.
